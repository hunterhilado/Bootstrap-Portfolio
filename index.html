        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My full name is Hunter Godfrey Hilado. I was born Januray 12th, 1997 in Dallas, TX to two wonderful parents named Michelle and Godfrey. Before I graduated High School I attended 10 different schools, spanning 5 states inclduing: Texas, West Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama and Florida. I have 1 sibling named Heath born in 2003. Moving around a lot was tough because no one likes being the new kid, but i look at it with a more optimistic view. I played many sports growing up but Lacrosse and MMA were my two favorites. I am a brown belt in Taekwondo, winning 5 gold medals in varying international tournaments I attended. I am also a blue belt in jiu-jitsu.</p>

        <h2>Interesting things about me</h2>
        <p>Some other interests I have include longboarding, gaming, paddleboading, working out and hanging out with friends. I currently work as a bouncer at a night club in Tallahassee called Recess where I forcefully help rulebreakers out of the premises. My goal in life is not to have the biggest house or fanciest car, but to live a worthwhile existence. I hope to gain a lot of skills and experience from this program so that I can move on into a future career.</p>
